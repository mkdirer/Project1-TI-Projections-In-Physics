# Projections In Physics
The topic of the project is the simulation of horizontal and inclined projectile motion. The webpage includes a top menu for easy navigation between sections. The theoretical introduction to projectile motion is available under the following options:

- Horizontal projectile - theory
- Inclined projectile - theory

Simulations illustrating the selected physical issue have been placed under the following options:

- Horizontal projectile - simulation
- Inclined projectile - simulation
## Simulation operation
The simulation interface consists of:

- Canvas element for displaying the simulation
- Table with updated projectile parameters
- Selection fields for initial simulation parameters
- Button to display a simple animation

The trajectory is updated after changing any initial parameter, and after clicking the "simulation" button, a simple animation appears. The simulation is reset after changing the initial parameters.

## Technologies:
- HTML5 and CSS
Using HTML elements, a webpage skeleton was created with appropriate content formatting. Elements such as \<header>, \<nav>, \<article>, \<video>, and \<footer> were used. The graphical representation of the projectiles was created using the \<canvas> element.

- JavaScript
JavaScript elements and functions such as getElementById and innerHTML were used to modify the HTML5 document. on... functions allowed for event handling, and operations on style properties such as style.display: none/block.
The webpage validates correctly on the W3C website according to HTML5 and CSS standards.
